# arm-control
The first place is to design the interface of the arm using HTML. We designed six engines and buttons to save and run. We used the JavaScript language to modify the shape in a superficial way, not deep. Then we built the database and linked it with the PHP file. These are the tasks that have been completed in this task..
Thank you very much
